					<p><span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: 70%;">In 2017, Sanjeev Bhikchandani wrote on Ashoka's founding ethos:</span> <br> <br>“[It was] our decision to focus the university solely on Liberal Arts and natural sciences. 
						We would stay away from professional courses such as engineering, medicine, management, law and others that are popular with middle class India because they maximise the chances of getting a job". 
				  </div>
				  <div class="step" data-step="2">
					<p><span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: 70%;">The race for job-security has resulted in a meteoric rise in demand for the ECO-FIN, Psychology, and Entrepreneurship degrees. In an interview with The Edict, Chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee revealed his understanding of incoming students' approach to studying at Ashoka:</span> <br> <br>
						“...I am going to study at Ashoka because Ashoka is going to provide me with a vista to a better placement or a better job.”</p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="step" data-step="2">
					<p><span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: 80%;">Meanwhile, the Humanities have struggled to compete.</span> <br> <br>
						"The Political Science department at Ashoka was deliberately gutted to address what some founders and administration members perceived to be a liability to the university”
						<br><br><span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: 70%;">said Professor Gilles Verniers, who left the Political Science Department in 2023, in an email correspondence with The Edict.</span></p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="step" data-step="4">
					<p style="color: #cccccc; font-size: 110%;">The Edict's data suggests that, 10 years after Ashoka was founded, the vast majority of the universty's students pursue subjects whose primary advantage is employability.
						They minor in subjects that expose them to business, and they stay for a fourth year quite possibly because of the placement opportunities, 
						during which year they once again primarily study entrepreneurship.</p>

						<h4 class="title" style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30%;">Data Indicates Shift in Ashoka's liberal arts ethos</h4>

						<br>
						<p>
							Only 20% of the undergraduate batch of 2024 (UG’24) graduated with degrees in English, History, and Political Science. 
							Just five years ago, this was not the case. About 35% of the graduating batch of 2019 (UG’19) majored in these disciplines. 
							The UG’19 batch size was only 60% of the UG’24 batch excluding late graduates. 
							Yet, there were more students who majored in English, History and Political Science. 
							After the resignation of former Vice-Chancellor Pratap Bhanu Mehta in April 2022, the proportion of students majoring in Political Science fell by half. 
							Other disciplines are also experiencing a downward trend. This year, the Philosophy department had only one graduate.
						</p>

						<p>
							Data from Ashoka’s Academic Management System (AMS) portal indicates that students are also taking more lucrative major-minor combinations. 
							Economics-Finance and Psychology majors often pursue minors in Entrepreneurship or Computer Science to maximise employability. 
							<span class="title" style="text-align: left; font-size: 110%">“It is definitely a very thought-out decision keeping in mind the job market",</span>
							says Hiba Hasan (ASP’25), Economics Student Representative (AY 23-24).
